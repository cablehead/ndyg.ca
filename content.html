<h2>How do you make a living?</h2>
<p>Some business models. If you’ve thoughts on this topic, there’s a discussion
going on <a href="https://x.com/cablelounger/status/1801611772564062508">here</a>.</p>
<h3>The <a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a> business model <small>(my current favorite)</small></h3>
<p>My take on this model is, build a community around some fun tools and generally
vibes, and charge a token amount to be a participant in the community.</p>
<h3>The “open source” business model</h3>
<p>Generally, create something that is useful to a lot of people and gift it to
them, then… make a living? This model seems like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO5sxLapAts">magical
thinking</a>, but it also seems like
it just has to work, somehow?</p>
<p>The xkcd comic highlighting how dependent the world is on open source software
is now a cliché, but it’s nonetheless obvious.</p>

<p>We need open source developers to be able to make a good living.</p>
<p>Some projects I’m watching with interest:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://atuin.sh">Atuin</a>: a tool to make your shell history searchable. I
probably activate atuin 10s of times an hour on a typical work day.

<a href="https://ellie.wtf/posts/i-quit-my-job-to-work-full-time-on-my-open-source-project">announced</a>
in Jan that she’d quit her job to work on it full time.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/usebruno/bruno">Bruno</a> an Opensource IDE For Exploring
and Testing Api’s (lightweight alternative to postman/insomnia). <a href="https://github.com/helloanoop">Anoop M
D</a>’s made an <a href="https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/discussions/269">excellent

sustainable open source.</li>

<h3>The benefactor business model, modifier</h3>
<p>A potential implementation variation of the other models is the “benefactor
business model”. This approach aims to make groupware software useful for small
communities, such as families and close groups of friends, by bypassing the
need for widespread adoption and network effects.</p>
<p>In most close-knit groups, there are usually a few tech enthusiasts who scout
for new software, particularly tools that can be used collectively. They often
serve as the community’s tech guides, recommending groupware software for
shared use.</p>
<p>The default suggestion usually falls on free, ad-supported groupware since it
allows everyone to start using it without financial commitment. Proposing a
paid service is challenging, as it requires unanimous agreement on payment
before participation.</p>
<p>The benefactor business model modifier aims to overcome the hurdle of
transitioning a community to a paid, ad-free platform. In this model, the tech
enthusiast(s), acting as benefactor(s), cover the subscription fee for the
entire group. Once subscribed, they can then provide the community with free
access to the service.</p>
<p>The benefactor can also have access to exclusive tools and features, tailored
to assist in supporting their community more effectively, particularly with
technology-related inquiries or needs.</p>
<p>The core idea is to enable communities to switch to a superior, ad-free service
without the barrier of individual members needing to pay upfront.</p>
<h3>The <a href="https://stratechery.com">“Ben Thompson”</a> business model</h3>
<p>Regularly create compelling content that people are willing to pay a
subscription for. Ben wasn’t the first to do this, but at least to me, stands
out as been being very good and successful with it. Substack is a more recent
platform that enables this model.</p>
<p>Some of my current favorite writers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com">Heather Cox Richardson</a></li>
<li><a href="https://phillipspobrien.substack.com">Phillips P. O’Brien</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.skillfulnotes.com">Benjamin Parry</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Is this model the same as the <a href="https://www.patreon.com">patronage</a> model?</p>
<h3>The SaaS Business Model</h3>
<p>Create and host software that provides value to users, who then pay a
subscription fee for access. Under the straight SaaS play business model, there
are pioneers like Salesforce and behemoths like GitHub, but I think the world
is more interesting with thousands of small, niche SaaS providers rather than a
few mega-services.</p>
<p>I find small indie SaaS projects inspiring, like Waterloo’s
<a href="https://x.com/smhanov">@smhanov</a>’s
<a href="https://websequencediagrams.com">websequencediagrams</a>. Unassuming on the
surface, it’s provided Steve a good living since 2012, even with the subsequent
competition from the open source Mermaid.</p>
<p>However, I’m really interested in
<a href="https://utopia.rosano.ca/interoperable-visions/">interop</a>, which leads you to
<a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/">local-first</a>, as
generally the traditional SaaS’ interests are in conflict with interop. And
then, as <a href="https://x.com/Zephraph">@Zephraph</a>
<a href="https://x.com/Zephraph/status/1798418469110902849">observed</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] localfirst goes against the SaaS winds. Most SaaS companies make money by
collecting data from a user and massaging it in a way that they control.
Stop paying, lose access. Local first turns that on its head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what to do there?</p>
