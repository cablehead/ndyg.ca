<h2>How do you make a living?</h2>
<p>Some business models. If you’ve thoughts on this topic, there’s a discussion
going on <a href="https://x.com/cablelounger/status/1801611772564062508">here</a>.</p>
<h3>The <a href="https://home.omg.lol">omg.lol</a> business model</h3>
<p>– <small>(my current favorite)</small>. My take on this model is, build a
community around some fun tools and generally vibes, and charge a token amount
to be a participant in the community.</p>
<h3>The “open source” business model</h3>
<p>– or generally create something that is useful to a lot of people, and gift it
to them, then.. make a living?</p>
<p>This model seems like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO5sxLapAts">magical
thinking</a>.. but, it also seems
like, it just has to work, somehow?</p>
<p>The xkcd comic highlighting how dependent
the world is on open source software is now a cliche, but none the less
obvious.</p>
<p><a href="https://xkcd.com/2347/"><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency.png" alt="Open source dependency" /></a></p>
<p>We need open source developers to be able to make a good living.</p>
<p>Some projects I’m watching with interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://atuin.sh">Atuin</a>: a tool to make your shell history searchable. I
probably activate atuin 10s of times an hour on a typical work day.
<a href="https://x.com/ellie_huxtable">Ellie</a>
<a href="https://ellie.wtf/posts/i-quit-my-job-to-work-full-time-on-my-open-source-project">announced</a>
in Jan that she’d quit her job to work on it full time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/usebruno/bruno">Bruno</a> an Opensource IDE For Exploring
and Testing Api’s (lightweight alternative to postman/insomnia). <a href="https://github.com/helloanoop">Anoop M
D</a>’s made an <a href="https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/discussions/269">excellent
post</a> on the need for
sustainable opensource.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://x.com/louispilfold/status/1817870737165664604">tweet</a> by <a href="https://x.com/louispilfold">Louis Pilfold</a> creator of the Gleam
programming langague caught my eye: ouch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>The <a href="https://stratechery.com">“Ben Thompson”</a> business model</h3>
<p>Regularly create compelling content that people are willing to pay a
subscription for. Ben wasn’t the first to do this, but at least to me stands
out as been very good, and successful with his it. Substack is a more recent
platform that enables this model.</p>
<p>Some of my current favorite writers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com">Heather Cox Richardson</a></li>
<li><a href="https://phillipspobrien.substack.com">Phillips P. Obrien</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.skillfulnotes.com">Benjamin Parry</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Is this model the same as the <a href="https://www.patreon.com">patronage</a> model?</p>
<h3>The SaaS Business Model</h3>
<p>Create and host software that provides value to users, who then pay a
subscription fee for access. Under the straight SaaS play business model, there
are pioneers like Salesforce and behemoths like GitHub, but I think the world
is more interesting with thousands of small, niche SaaS providers rather than a
few mega-services.</p>
<p>I find small indie SaaS projects inspiring, like Waterloo’s
<a href="https://x.com/smhanov">@smhanov</a>’s
<a href="https://websequencediagrams.com">websequencediagrams</a>. Unassuming on the
surface, it’s provided Steve a good living since 2012, even with the subsequent
competition from the open-source Mermaid.</p>
<p>However, I’m really interested in interop, which leads you to localfirst, as
generally the traditional SaaS’ interests are in conflict with interop. And
then, as <a href="https://x.com/Zephraph">@Zephraph</a>
<a href="https://x.com/Zephraph/status/1798418469110902849">observed</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] localfirst goes against the SaaS winds. Most SaaS companies make money by
collecting data from a user and massaging it in a way that they control.
Stop paying, lose access. Local first turns that on its head.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what to do there?</p>
