## <small>Planting /</small><br/>What Constitutes a Good Living?

This page explores the concept of what constitutes a "good" living by examining
the financial, social, and personal factors that contribute to a fulfilling
lifestyle. The focus is on quantifying the amount of income needed to achieve a
comfortable and sustainable standard of living, considering various individual
and societal benchmarks.

- This page makes more sense if you're familar with the idea of a [digital
  garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history).

A starting point:

- We want _everyone_ to have a good living (like, all 8 billion of us). This is
  a truism for me, but does everyone think this way? (might be a planting in
  its own right)
- As a placeholder, I'm using $200K USD per year to define a good living.
- However, this amount and framing are obviously not right.
- For a start, we have to account for factors such as the local economic
  region.
- We need to consider previously accumulated wealth. For instance, $200K in New
  York City when you already own a comfortable apartment outright versus
  starting from scratch and renting are very different scenarios.
- And of course, if you give everyone $200K, it would distort our current
  economic systems in a way that it would essentially be meaningless.
- So this page should iterate on defining a good living by focusing on
  lifestyle and affordances, then work backwards to quantify/model that in a
  realistic way.
