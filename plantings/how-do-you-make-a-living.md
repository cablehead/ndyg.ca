## <small>Planting /</small><br/>How do you make a living?

<small>(for tech folks considering an indie path)</small>

This page explores sustainable business models for software developers who
specialize in creating tools, automating systems, and building niche services.
The focus is on fostering an ecosystem where thousands of smaller, specialized
software projects can thrive alongside the dominant tech giants by catering to
specific, niche audiences.

### The [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol) business model <small>(my current favorite)</small>

My take on this model is, build a community around some fun tools and generally
vibes, and charge a token amount to be a participant in the community.

### The "open source" business model

Generally, create something useful for many people, gift it to them, then… make
a living? This model seems like
[magical thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO5sxLapAts), but it also
seems like it just has to work, somehow?

The xkcd comic highlighting how dependent the world is on open source software
is now a cliché, but it's nonetheless obvious.

<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency.png" alt="Open source dependency" class="image-xkcd">

The world relies on open source, and developers need to make a good living to
keep it secure and thriving. Importantly, 20 GitHub sponsors at $5/month is a
deeply unserious solution. We need to be thinking in terms of $200K USD per
developer per year. So how do we achieve that?

Some projects I'm watching with interest:

- [Atuin](https://atuin.sh): a tool to make your shell history searchable. I
  probably activate Atuin 10s of times an hour on a typical work day.
  [Ellie](https://x.com/ellie_huxtable)
  [announced](https://ellie.wtf/posts/i-quit-my-job-to-work-full-time-on-my-open-source-project)
  in Jan that she'd quit her job to work on it full time.
- [Bruno](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno) an open-source IDE for exploring
  and testing APIs (think lightweight alternative to Postman or Insomnia).
  [Anoop M D](https://github.com/helloanoop)'s made an
  [excellent post](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/discussions/269) on the
  need for sustainable open source.

- A [tweet](https://x.com/louispilfold/status/1817870737165664604) by
  [Louis Pilfold](https://x.com/louispilfold), creator of the
  [Gleam](https://gleam.run) programming language, caught my eye: ouch.

### The benefactor business model modifier

A barrier to adopting specialized groupware apps is the need for the entire
group to adopt the app for it to be usable at all. For example, a chat channel
for a family group only works when everyone in the group is able to
participate.

The "benefactor business model" aims to address this "all-or-nothing"
requirement by having one enthusiastic group member pay for the entire group.
In close-knit groups, tech enthusiasts often serve as the community's tech
guides, usually recommending free, ad-supported groupware to avoid financial
commitment from others.

This model transforms these enthusiasts into benefactors who cover the
subscription fee for the whole group. As a result, the community gains access
to a superior, ad-free service without requiring individual members to pay.
Benefactors may also receive exclusive tools and features to aid in tech
support and community management.

This modifier can be applied to the other business models to overcome adoption
barriers in small, close-knit groups.

### The ["Ben Thompson"](https://stratechery.com) business model

Regularly create compelling content that people are willing to pay a
subscription for. Ben wasn't the first to do this, but at least to me, stands
out as being very good and successful with it. Substack is a more recent
platform that enables this model.

Here are some of my favorite writers who use this model. Of these, my
impression is that only Tangle is positioned to make a comfortable living
solely from their writing:

- [Heather Cox Richardson](https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com)
- [Phillips P. O’Brien](https://phillipspobrien.substack.com)
- [Benjamin Parry](https://www.skillfulnotes.com)
- [Tangle](https://www.readtangle.com), who have [now left
  Substack](https://tangle.substack.com/p/we-are-no-longer-on-substack)

Is this model the same as the [patronage](https://www.patreon.com) model?

### The SaaS Business Model

Create and host software that provides value to users, who then pay a
subscription fee for access. Under the straight SaaS play business model, there
are pioneers like Salesforce and behemoths like GitHub, but I think the world is
more interesting with thousands of small, niche SaaS providers rather than a few
mega services.

I find small indie SaaS projects inspiring, like Waterloo's
[@smhanov](https://x.com/smhanov)'s
[websequencediagrams](https://websequencediagrams.com). Unassuming on the
surface, it's provided Steve a good living since 2012, even with the subsequent
competition from the open source Mermaid.

However, I'm really interested in
[interop](https://utopia.rosano.ca/interoperable-visions/), which leads you to
[local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/), as generally the
traditional SaaS' interests are in conflict with interop. And then, as
[@Zephraph](https://x.com/Zephraph)
[observed](https://x.com/Zephraph/status/1798418469110902849)

> [...] localfirst goes against the SaaS winds. Most SaaS companies make money
> by collecting data from a user and massaging it in a way that they control.
> Stop paying, lose access. Local first turns that on its head.

So what to do there?
