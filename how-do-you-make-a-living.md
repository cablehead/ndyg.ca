## <small>Planting /</small> <br/>How do you make a living?

This page explores sustainable business models for software developers who
specialize in creating tools, automating systems, and building niche services.
The focus is on supporting a diverse ecosystem of smaller, specialized software
projects rather than a few dominant tech giants.

### The [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol) business model <small>(my current favorite)</small>

My take on this model is, build a community around some fun tools and generally
vibes, and charge a token amount to be a participant in the community.

### The "open source" business model

Generally, create something useful for many people, gift it to them, then… make
a living? This model seems like
[magical thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO5sxLapAts), but it also
seems like it just has to work, somehow?

The xkcd comic highlighting how dependent the world is on open source software
is now a cliché, but it's nonetheless obvious.

<p style="margin: 0 auto">
<img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/dependency.png" alt="Open source dependency" class="image-xkcd">
</p>

The world relies on open source, and developers need to make a good living to
keep it secure and thriving. Importantly, 20 GitHub sponsors at $5/month is a
deeply unserious solution. We need to be thinking in terms of $200K USD per
developer per year. So how do we achieve that?

Some projects I'm watching with interest:

- [Atuin](https://atuin.sh): a tool to make your shell history searchable. I
  probably activate Atuin 10s of times an hour on a typical work day.
  [Ellie](https://x.com/ellie_huxtable)
  [announced](https://ellie.wtf/posts/i-quit-my-job-to-work-full-time-on-my-open-source-project)
  in Jan that she'd quit her job to work on it full time.
- [Bruno](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno) an open-source IDE for exploring
  and testing APIs (think lightweight alternative to Postman or Insomnia).
  [Anoop M D](https://github.com/helloanoop)'s made an
  [excellent post](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/discussions/269) on the
  need for sustainable open source.

- A [tweet](https://x.com/louispilfold/status/1817870737165664604) by
  [Louis Pilfold](https://x.com/louispilfold), creator of the
  [Gleam](https://gleam.run) programming language, caught my eye: ouch.

### The benefactor business model modifier

A potential implementation variation of the other models is the “benefactor
business model,” aimed at making groupware software useful for small
communities, such as families and close groups of friends, by bypassing the need
for widespread adoption and network effects.

In close-knit groups, tech enthusiasts often scout for new software and serve as
the community’s tech guides. They usually recommend free, ad-supported groupware
to avoid financial commitment. Proposing a paid service is challenging due to
the need for unanimous agreement on payment.

This model overcomes that hurdle by having tech enthusiasts act as benefactors,
covering the subscription fee for the entire group. This allows the community to
access a superior, ad-free service without individual members needing to pay
upfront. Benefactors may also gain access to exclusive tools and features,
aiding in tech support and community management.

### The ["Ben Thompson"](https://stratechery.com) business model

Regularly create compelling content that people are willing to pay a
subscription for. Ben wasn't the first to do this, but at least to me, stands
out as being very good and successful with it. Substack is a more recent
platform that enables this model.

Some of my current favorite writers:

- [Heather Cox Richardson](https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com)
- [Phillips P. O’Brien](https://phillipspobrien.substack.com)
- [Benjamin Parry](https://www.skillfulnotes.com)

Is this model the same as the [patronage](https://www.patreon.com) model?

### The SaaS Business Model

Create and host software that provides value to users, who then pay a
subscription fee for access. Under the straight SaaS play business model, there
are pioneers like Salesforce and behemoths like GitHub, but I think the world is
more interesting with thousands of small, niche SaaS providers rather than a few
mega services.

I find small indie SaaS projects inspiring, like Waterloo's
[@smhanov](https://x.com/smhanov)'s
[websequencediagrams](https://websequencediagrams.com). Unassuming on the
surface, it's provided Steve a good living since 2012, even with the subsequent
competition from the open source Mermaid.

However, I'm really interested in
[interop](https://utopia.rosano.ca/interoperable-visions/), which leads you to
[local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/), as generally the
traditional SaaS' interests are in conflict with interop. And then, as
[@Zephraph](https://x.com/Zephraph)
[observed](https://x.com/Zephraph/status/1798418469110902849)

> [...] localfirst goes against the SaaS winds. Most SaaS companies make money
> by collecting data from a user and massaging it in a way that they control.
> Stop paying, lose access. Local first turns that on its head.

So what to do there?
