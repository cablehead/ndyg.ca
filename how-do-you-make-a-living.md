## How do you make a living?

Some business models. If you've thoughts on this topic, there's a discussion
going on [here](https://x.com/cablelounger/status/1801611772564062508).

### The [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol) business model <small>(my current favorite)</small>

My take on this model is, build a community around some fun tools and generally
vibes, and charge a token amount to be a participant in the community.

### The "open source" business model

Generally, create something useful for many people, gift it to them, then… make
a living? This model seems like
[magical thinking](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO5sxLapAts), but it also
seems like it just has to work, somehow?

The xkcd comic highlighting how dependent the world is on open source software
is now a cliché, but it's nonetheless obvious.

</p>

We need open source developers to be able to make a good living.

Some projects I'm watching with interest:

- [Atuin](https://atuin.sh): a tool to make your shell history searchable. I
  probably activate Atuin 10s of times an hour on a typical work day.
  [Ellie](https://x.com/ellie_huxtable)
  [announced](https://ellie.wtf/posts/i-quit-my-job-to-work-full-time-on-my-open-source-project)
  in Jan that she'd quit her job to work on it full time.
- [Bruno](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno) an open-source IDE for exploring
  and testing APIs (think lightweight alternative to Postman or Insomnia).
  [Anoop M D](https://github.com/helloanoop)'s made an
  [excellent post](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno/discussions/269) on the
  need for sustainable open source.
- Zellij
- A [tweet](https://x.com/louispilfold/status/1817870737165664604) by
  [Louis Pilfold](https://x.com/louispilfold), creator of the
  [Gleam](https://gleam.run) programming language, caught my eye: ouch.

### The benefactor business model modifier

A potential implementation variation of the other models is the "benefactor
business model". This approach aims to make groupware software useful for small
communities, such as families and close groups of friends, by bypassing the need
for widespread adoption and network effects.

In most close-knit groups, there are usually a few tech enthusiasts who scout
for new software, particularly tools that can be used collectively. They often
serve as the community's tech guides, recommending groupware software for shared
use.

The default suggestion usually falls on free, ad-supported groupware since it
allows everyone to start using it without financial commitment. Proposing a paid
service is challenging, as it requires unanimous agreement on payment before
participation.

The benefactor business model modifier aims to overcome the hurdle of
transitioning a community to a paid, ad-free platform. In this model, the tech
enthusiast(s), acting as benefactor(s), cover the subscription fee for the
entire group. Once subscribed, they can then provide the community with free
access to the service.

The benefactor can also have access to exclusive tools and features, tailored to
assist in supporting their community more effectively, particularly with
technology-related inquiries or needs.

The core idea is to enable communities to switch to a superior, ad-free service
without the barrier of individual members needing to pay upfront.

### The ["Ben Thompson"](https://stratechery.com) business model

Regularly create compelling content that people are willing to pay a
subscription for. Ben wasn't the first to do this, but at least to me, stands
out as being very good and successful with it. Substack is a more recent
platform that enables this model.

Some of my current favorite writers:

- [Heather Cox Richardson](https://heathercoxrichardson.substack.com)
- [Phillips P. O’Brien](https://phillipspobrien.substack.com)
- [Benjamin Parry](https://www.skillfulnotes.com)

Is this model the same as the [patronage](https://www.patreon.com) model?

### The SaaS Business Model

Create and host software that provides value to users, who then pay a
subscription fee for access. Under the straight SaaS play business model, there
are pioneers like Salesforce and behemoths like GitHub, but I think the world is
more interesting with thousands of small, niche SaaS providers rather than a few
mega services.

I find small indie SaaS projects inspiring, like Waterloo's
[@smhanov](https://x.com/smhanov)'s
[websequencediagrams](https://websequencediagrams.com). Unassuming on the
surface, it's provided Steve a good living since 2012, even with the subsequent
competition from the open source Mermaid.

However, I'm really interested in
[interop](https://utopia.rosano.ca/interoperable-visions/), which leads you to
[local-first](https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first/), as generally the
traditional SaaS' interests are in conflict with interop. And then, as
[@Zephraph](https://x.com/Zephraph)
[observed](https://x.com/Zephraph/status/1798418469110902849)

> [...] localfirst goes against the SaaS winds. Most SaaS companies make money
> by collecting data from a user and massaging it in a way that they control.
> Stop paying, lose access. Local first turns that on its head.

So what to do there?
